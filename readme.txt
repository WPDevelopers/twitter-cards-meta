**Why Twitter Cards Meta is The Best Solution?**

You could say there are other process like adding codes manually in your theme header, or using famous SEO plugins like "WordPress SEO by Yoast" or other plugin that claim to serve same like this plugin, but why we are the best? Here is our point -

*  All other plugin either need per post configuration or they just cant handle more then one type Card. With **Twitter Card Meta** you could configure **one article post as Summary Card and another image heavy post as Photo Card**, and you don't have to pick image, description etc manually on any of those post. Just install and you will understand the difference.
*  With other plugin you can't change Card type sitewide all together. **Twitter Card Meta** let you do that. 
*  This plugin is extendable, we are releasing all new Card type Twitter release as addon, so you never loose your setting, and could adopt your site with any Card type in future. 
*   None other solution works perfectly with image. All other plugins only depend on WordPress Attachment. But from our years of experience we have seen image attachment does not work for most of the sites and themes.
*   Other plugin will mostly use your default image as they cant grab image properly, even "WordPress SEO by Yoast" does the same. But please read the Twitter Cards' [guideline and terms](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) guideline about image. It clearly says 'Do not use a generic image such as your website logo, author photo, or other image that spans multiple pages.' So if you end up using default image for most posts, you will probably never get approved in Twitter Cards.
*   This plugin does the markup in right way, and in right position.
*   **New** Only this plugin handles both 'Summary Card' and 'Photo Card' properly.
*   **New** Only this plugin has the option to select Twitter 'Card Type' per post basis, right from post panel.

The main thing is, we had to make this plugin as other solution did not worked for most of our projects. So we have learned from others' limitation, and we come-up with better solution. We have already added Photo Card and will add Player Card support very soon.

**ABetterUserExperience.com** [saying](http://abetteruserexperience.com/2013/04/drive-social-engagement-for-your-content-by-adding-third-party-meta-data-heres-how/)

"*...Yoast isn't really a fully functional implementation of the Twitter Card standard. To my knowledge, it doesn't take into account, for example, pictures or videos... And the plugin that's best to use it called Twitter Cards Meta by WPdeveloper. The plugin couldn't be easier. Install it and just fill out a few fields and that's it.*"

**WPSolver.com** [saying](http://www.wpsolver.com/twitter-cards-plugins-wordpress/)

"*Twitter Cards Meta: enables summary and photo cards on your site. You will be able to customize your cards’ settings. It also works for sites with multiple authors."*
